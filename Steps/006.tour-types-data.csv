Extreme Snorkeling,"The ocean is a beautiful place, but when snorkeling you typically only see the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. If you crave going deeper, but scoff at the idea of dragging air in giant tanks on your back or don't have the time to get scuba-certified, then extreme snorkeling can take you where you want to go. We use a patented float tube that telescopes up to 200 feet to allow you to submerge yourself in the darkness of the water and enjoy the larger and more intimidating wildlife of the deeper ocean.","Ability to swim and comfort with or willingness to overcome discomfort with dark, expansive spaces.",Phil Terry
Cathartic Tunnelling,"On our two-week tunneling tours, we take you into the depths of the earth where you work with your team to dig a mile-long tunnel using only hand shovels and buckets. Our tunneling tours take place across the globe in areas where you're likely to run into unfamiliar subterranean creatures and discover colorful, foreign substrates. During the course of the tour, we guarantee a significant increase in upper body strength and sensitivity to sunlight. On the final night, you will emerge from your tunnel to a candlelight buffet, solar-heated showers, and massages.","Healthy cardiovascular system, comfort with or willingness to overcome discomfort with the dark and confined spaces.",Phil Terry
Desert Spin,"Imagine Hot Yoga without the unnecessary energy consumption that's required to heat a room to extreme temperatures. In desert spin, we set up an array of spin bikes in some of the hottest deserts on the planet so you can experience the muscle-relaxing properties of the dry heat and sweat it out in a broad expanse of nature. Our entire fleet of bikes rest on a giant turntable that is manually rotated throughout each class to ensure even sun exposure to each facet of your body.",Comfort with or willingness to overcome discomfort with very warm temperatures.,Joey Smitty
S(BASE) Jumping,"For those who have realized that an activity with a 1 in 60 risk of death just isn't high enough to enjoy any more, we offer an alternative. BASE jumping, but in space. We've partnered with a space expedition company to provide trips to the very edge of our thin atmosphere to where you will be outfitted with a heat-resistant space suit that will, upon your descent, automatically disengage when reaching a certain altitude. After becoming free from the necessary encumbrance, you will be able to use your wing suit to guide yourself to anywhere across the Pacific ocean, where your suit will automatically inflate and become a raft with homing beacon. This particular sport is new enough that we don't have survival statistics, but if you're looking for risk, this is a winning ticket.",Comfort or willingness to overcome discomfort with heights.,Joey Smitty
Pogo Mountain Marathon,"Inspired by Phil Terry's perceived childhood pogo stick inadequacy, we have created a long-distance pogo journey. We call it a marathon, but it clocks in at just under 20 miles. There's only one rule: Touch the ground with any part of your body and you go back to the beginning. Using only a regulation pogo stick, you will climb up and down through the beautiful Adirondack mountain ranges. But don't be distracted by the wildlife, because you will need your full concentration to complete this tour.",Shin guards.,Kate Zanzerblath
