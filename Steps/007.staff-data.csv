Kate,Zanzerblath,Guide,"Katie was MagnifAscent's first employee. She's dedicated and pushes the limits, but always manages to find the sweet spot for our clients. In her spare time, Katie is an expert poodle hair stylist. We like to say that she plays with doggie doos!",kate@magnifascenttours.com
Joey,Smitty,Guide,"Joey is the brain behind most of our original extreme sports. When he's not in the hospital recovering from his research, he practices levitation. So, if you're on a Smitty tour and can't find your guide, look up.",joey@magnifascenttours.com
Phil,Terry,"Guide, Founder","Phil is a born entrepreneur and a bit of an agoraphobe. After successfully undergoing exposure therapy and finding himself rapidly running out of fears, Phil took a windfall from a lucritive business acquisition and put together a crack team of adventurers to help him conquer phobias that were beyond the scope of his therapist's contract. Fears like asphyxiating is space, dehydrating in the desert and being out-pogoed by his childhood nemesis. When his freinds would invariably desperately ask to join him on his next tour after inquiring about his various wounds, the entrepreneur in his blood realized that he had stumbled on a business model, and MagnifAscent was born.",phil@magnifascenttours.com
Bobby,Method,Public Relations,"Bobby knows how to (desert) spin a good story, and he's also quite the adventurer himself. Having hangglidded (hangglid?) for 24 hours straight, beating the world record by a signficant margin, he gathered up everything he learned about the press and forged out to find a place that could use his talents, but that would also respect his needing to bail to take advantage of a good thermal.",bobby@magnifascenttours.com
Sandra,Danger,Website Administrator,"Danger' used to only be her middle name, but after taking the surname of her husband, it is now Sandra's last name as well. Sandra appreciates the risks that her co-workers take on a daily basis with their crazy death-defying stunts that can be only loosely described as 'tours' and should more accurately be labeled 'activities for which death or dismemberment is the most likely outcome.', but she's not so interested in participating. So, she prefers to spend her days in the air conditioned office, applying her doctorate of archeology to managing the MagnifAscent web site. That, and troubleshooting network issues. And setting up new hardware. And ordering supplies for the portapotty. And helping the staff's family with email issues. And...",sandra@magnifascenttours.com
